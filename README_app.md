## üíæ Database Management System

The app integrates specially designed components to handle SQLite databases with flexibility and robustness:

### File Path Connection System

For connecting to local database files, the app provides:

- **Direct Path Connection**: Connect to databases using file paths, bypassing the 200MB upload limit of Streamlit
- **Path Format Handling**: Intelligent handling of various path formats (Windows backslashes, forward slashes, etc.)
- **Path Conversion Tool**: Utility to convert between different path formats
- **Path Validation**: Comprehensive checks for file existence, readability, and format

### Thread-Safe Database Connections

SQLite has a limitation where connections can only be used in the thread they were created in. Our app implements:

- **Connection Pooling**: Maintains separate connections for different threads
- **Thread-Local Storage**: Thread-specific connection tracking
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Detects and handles thread errors by reconnecting in the current thread
- **Safe Query Execution**: Wrapped query methods to handle thread-safety issues gracefully

### Database Structure Flexibility

To accommodate variations in LMT database structures:

- **Flexible Schema Detection**: Identifies required tables regardless of capitalization or naming variations
- **Alternative Table Recognition**: Detects alternative table names (e.g., EVENT vs EVENTS)
- **Table Structure Diagnostics**: Detailed reporting of expected vs. actual database structure
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to alternative tables when standard ones are missing

## üß† Analysis Capabilities

The analysis system is built to handle behavioral data with sophistication:

### Feature Processing

- **Feature Extraction**: Extracts behavioral features from raw event data
- **Feature Selection**: Identifies and selects relevant features based on variance and correlation
- **Feature Standardization**: Normalizes features for consistent analysis
- **Feature Categorization**: Separates social and individual behavior features

### Dimensionality Reduction

- **PCA Implementation**: Principal Component Analysis for unsupervised dimensionality reduction
- **LDA Implementation**: Linear Discriminant Analysis for supervised dimensionality reduction
- **Variance Analysis**: Explained variance tracking and visualization
- **Feature Importance**: Identification of key features contributing to components

## üìä Visualization System

The visualization system provides interactive and informative views of the data:

- **PCA/LDA Plots**: Interactive scatter plots of dimensionality reduction results
- **Feature Correlation Heatmaps**: Visualize relationships between behavioral features
- **Feature Importance Charts**: Bar charts showing feature contributions to components
- **Behavior Distribution Plots**: Distribution visualizations for specific behaviors

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Thread Safety Implementation

SQLite connections in Python can only be used in the thread they were created in. Our solution includes:

```python
# Connection pool for thread-safety
_connection_pool = {}
_thread_local = threading.local()

def get_db_connection(db_path):
    # Get current thread ID
    thread_id = threading.get_ident()
    
    # Use thread-specific connection
    thread_key = f"{normalized_path}_{thread_id}"
    if thread_key in _connection_pool:
        return _connection_pool[thread_key]
    
    # Create new connection for this thread
    conn = sqlite3.connect(normalized_path, check_same_thread=False)
    _connection_pool[thread_key] = conn
    return conn
```

This pattern is applied to all database interaction functions, allowing seamless operation across Streamlit's multi-threaded environment.

### Database Structure Compatibility

The app is specifically designed to work with the user's LMT database structure:

```python
# Standard tables in the user's database
expected_structure = ['ANIMAL', 'EVENT', 'DETECTION', 'FRAME', 'LOG', 'sqlite_sequence']

# Flexible table checking
has_animal = 'ANIMAL' in tables
has_event = 'EVENT' in tables or 'EVENTS' in tables

# Can proceed with minimum required tables
return has_animal and has_event
```

This allows the app to work with different variations of LMT database structures.

### Path Handling for Windows Compatibility

Special care is taken to handle Windows paths properly:

```python
# Replace backslashes with forward slashes
path = path.replace('\\', '/')

# Handle escaped backslashes
path = path.replace('//', '/')

# Normalize path separators
path = os.path.normpath(path)
```

This ensures that paths with spaces, special characters, and different slash styles all work correctly.

## üöÄ Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- SQLite database from LMT experiments

### Installation Steps

1. **Create and activate a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv streamlit_env
   
   # Windows
   .\streamlit_env\Scripts\activate
   
   # macOS/Linux
   source streamlit_env/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies in the correct order**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy>=1.23.5
   pip install scipy>=1.9.0

   pip install -r streamlit_app/requirements.txt
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app/app.py
   ```

## üìã Using the Application

### Connecting to a Database

1. Navigate to the "Database Management" page
2. Use the "Connect via File Path" option for large database files (>200MB)
3. Enter the full path to your SQLite database file
4. If the file has spaces or special characters, use the Path Format Converter

### Working with Large Databases

For databases larger than 200MB:
- Always use the file path connection method instead of uploading
- Ensure your database has the required tables (`ANIMAL` and `EVENT`)
- If using a non-standard table structure, check the tables found in the connection diagnostic

### Running SQL Queries

1. Connect to a database
2. Go to the "Run SQL Queries" tab
3. Enter your SQL query
4. If you encounter a thread error, try running the query again (the app will reconnect automatically)

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Thread-Related Errors
- **Symptom**: "SQLite objects created in a thread can only be used in that same thread"
- **Solution**: The app will automatically attempt to reconnect. If the error persists, refresh the page.

#### Database Connection Failures
- **Symptom**: "Failed to connect to the database"
- **Solution**: Check that the path is correct and the file exists. Use the Path Format Converter if needed.

#### Missing Tables
- **Symptom**: "The database does not appear to be a valid LMT database"
- **Solution**: The app now recognizes alternative table structures (EVENT instead of EVENTS). If your table structure is different, it will still try to work with it.
